# json-hyperschemas

Within Mozilla, we have several APIs (e.g. buildapi, clobberer, (modern) mapper, mozpool, slavealloc, slaveapi, ...) to talk to our internal systems. This project standardises on a way of defining them, publishing them, documenting them, and sharing them. This project will use json hyperschema (see e.g. https://brandur.org/elegant-apis) to define the apis. Please get involved to help define a framework for auto testing/validating the schemas, auto documenting/publishing the apis, and even auto-generating client libraries for them in languages like python, node.js etc. We are also interested in investigating http://swagger.io/.

Example REST apis that we have are:

* Build API: https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Applications/BuildAPI
* Clobberer: https://api.pub.build.mozilla.org/docs/usage/clobberer/#endpoints
* Mozpool: http://hg.mozilla.org/build/mozpool/file/tip/API.txt
* Slave API: http://mozilla-slaveapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/#slaves-slave-actions-disable

We need help with creating hyperschemas for the above APIs (and potentially others too), finding a good place to publish these references, and look at setting up some tools to generate documentation for these APIs, together with code generation of client libraries, and their associated documentation (godoc, javadoc, â€¦) and auto-generation and deployment of new documentation, libraries, as and when these json hyper schemas get updated (perhaps with travis ci deploying to e.g. github pages or heroku).
